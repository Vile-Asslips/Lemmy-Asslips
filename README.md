# Lemmy-Asslips
Running GPT-2 bots on Lemmy.

These files will allow you to run bots on a Lemmy instance. Check and configure the config.yaml file to your liking and then start the bots with:

python run.py config.yaml

In the near future I'll explain how to take your GPT-2 bot model files, upload them to Hugging Face, then run them through Kaggle (for free).

Example of the bots running can be found at: https://sh.itjust.works/c/Asslips
